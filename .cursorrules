# Action: Readying the code for committing

## When to use

Run at the end of every long run action that is taken. In other words, after a full set of changes have been made or proposed and you would think of it as ready for review/commit.

## What to do (step-by-step)

1. `cd` to the root directory
2. Ensure the pyenv is sourced: `source ./venv-dev/bin/activate` or `source ./venv/bin/activate`
3. Run `make format`
4. Run `make lint_full`
5. Run `make test`

## Constraints

- If any make steps fail, fix and re-run.
- Do not install any packages or attempt to run anything as su to fix anything
- You can run `make test TESTMODULE=<name_of_test_python_file>` to directly run a specific test vs all of them
- Never use lazy python imports

# Action: make refactors

## When to use

Whenever you're making refactors to modules that involve renaming.

## What to do

When making refactors that deprecate a file/module, do not accomodate for backwards compatibility unless specifically told to do so.

# Adding documentation

## What to do

When adding documentation (as markdown), include it in the docs folder
